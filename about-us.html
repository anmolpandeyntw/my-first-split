            <h1>Our Story</h1>
            <p style="text-align: left; max-width: 700px; margin: auto;">
                This project was born from a real, everyday problem. As roommates living together, we were constantly buying groceries, paying bills, and sharing expenses. Keeping track of who paid for what, when, and how to split it became a chore. We tried notebooks and endless WhatsApp chats, but details were always lost, calculations were messy, and it led to confusion and frustration.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: left; max-width: 700px; margin: 15px auto;">
                We needed a simple, shared space where anyone in the group could add an expense the moment it happened, see a clear history, and know exactly where they stand. That's why SplitSmart was created: to bring transparency and simplicity to shared living. Our vision is to eliminate the small financial frictions of daily life, so you can focus on what really matters.
